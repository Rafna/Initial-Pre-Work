/* Order of styling matters in CSS but order of class declaration doesn't matters in HTML. Here pink-text class styling is done
before blue-text class styling. But the color of h1 element came as blue-text class styling even after changing the order of
class declaration in the html. This means one element style can be override with another style if second style is given later.

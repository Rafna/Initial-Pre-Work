This is helpful to break a long string over several lines. concatenation
does not add spaces between concatenated strings. */

var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence."
